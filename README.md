# Analyzing-COVID-19
Trying to investigate the Covid-19 database to deduce the effect of age and gender on the death of individuals.

There were two objectives for this exercise. First I wanted to validate the claim that more older people were dying form Covid-19. 
Secondly I wanted to investigate whether men had a higher chance of dying from Covid-19 than women.
